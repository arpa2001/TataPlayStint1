# IT Delivery

This is a representation of the delivery process for the design of custom crawlers.

## Approach

- Use of Quarkus framework to add dependencies for Gson and Jsoup libraries.  
    Gson library helps converting a Data-Structure to a `.json` file.  
    Jsoup library helps fetching source code of a given URI.

- Using Maven under the Quarkus framework for adding the dependencies.

## Workflow

- Adding `com.google.code.gson` for Gson library.
- Adding `org.jsoup` for Jsoup library.
